An attempt to make a Blazor Azure Static Web App using Azure Functions

Inital scope:
The goal is for this to be a Blazor Webassembly application, using azure functions and in memory objects. Each page should have an export to CSV page for posterity, and further tracking.  I am not currently planning for the draft results to also be on this page. Only the draft functionality is important here.
